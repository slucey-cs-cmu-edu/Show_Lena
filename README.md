# Show_Lena

Simple example to show the Lena image using OpenCV. Need to make sure
the OpenCV path is set properly in the Makefile_Darwin. Simple copy
across your working version from the Example_OCV project. 

To build simply bring up a terminal on either Mac, Linux or Cygwin (Windows) and type, 

$ make

You should find the executable Detect_Lena now in the directory. At the command line simple type, 

$ ./Show_Lena

To run the program.
